# Study Buddy — Student Timetable (Casual)

This is a small, student-y timetable app meant to feel like a quick project you'd build for class. It's intentionally simple — easy to customize and hack on.

Features

- Quick timetable grid in `src/components/TimetablePlanner.jsx` (stores data in `localStorage`).
- Playful colors and emoji tags per subject — made to look like a student's app.
- "Load sample" button to populate the grid with example tasks.

Tips

- Click the `+` on a cell to select it, pick a subject, type a short task and press "Add to slot".
- Use the "Load sample" button in the sidebar to see example items.
- Data is stored locally — no account needed.
